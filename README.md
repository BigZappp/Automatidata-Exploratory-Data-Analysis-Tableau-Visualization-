The purpose of this project is to conduct exploratory data analysis on a provided data set. The mission is to continue the investigation i began in C2 and perform further EDA on this data with the aim of learning more about the variables.
The goal is to clean data set and create a visualization.

This activity has 4 parts:

Part 1: Imports, links, and loading

Part 2: Data Exploration

Data cleaning

Part 3: Building visualizations

Part 4: Evaluate and share results

The management team is asking for a Python notebook showing data structuring and cleaning, as well as any matplotlib/seaborn visualizations plotted to help understand the data. At the very least, include a box plot of the ride durations and some time series plots, like a breakdown by quarter or month.
